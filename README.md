# AOC 2022

Having fun with this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

I am using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Input Files
I use the `requests` library to get input data directly from website. Since input data varies by user, you will need your own cookie :cookie:. I save the cookie in `secrets.txt` in the root folder.

This is what `secrets.txt` looks like:

```python
[session_info]
cookie=YOUR_COOKIE_HERE
```
Cheers!
